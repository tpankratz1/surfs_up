- The differences between June and December temperatures are fairly small. A difference of about 4 degrees in average temperatures between the two months tells us that the temperature doesn't fluctuate much throughout the year.

## Summary

The following additional queries help to make the case even stronger, showing that average precipitation is fairly small and should not disrupt having a shop in Oahu:

- June precipitation in Oahu averages .14 inches, which appears to be favorable for setting up the shop, since many days have little or no precipitation. See *June Precipitation*, below.
